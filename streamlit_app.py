Dear friends, on the same day, another wedding will take place in the village. Therefore, please follow the navigation marked with initials A + M. Additionally, the traditional Chříč
Rally will also be happening in the village. Yes, you heard it right. We perceive it as a positive and sincere
start to our married life, one filled with surprises and challenges. In case the traditional automotive

The party will commence with a toast at approximately 3:30 PM, launching a radiant ball on the castle
terrace. To harmonise with the atmosphere, we urge you to bring something that sparkles. It can be
jewellery, a piece of clothing, flat shoes, or anything else. Glitter has no limits. We kindly ask all guests to avoid clumsy footwear that could lead to unwanted dance mishaps. Instead, we recommend stylish and comfortable shoes so you can enjoy the festivities carefree.

Due to our scattered possessions across various European lands and beyond, we do not wish for traditional
material gifts. However, if you would be so kind and wish to support us, we would gratefully accept a
financial contribution towards our journey into the world, which will take place in the winter months. Your
assistance will help us explore exotic destinations and build shared memories that will fuel our peaceful
marriage during times of conflict and challenge.
